                      <li>1.Having a profession as a driver requires a capable mind and body as driving recklessly on the road can cause accidents. Even worse, it can cause death. 
                          This is why LTO said that candidates must be physically and mentally fit to operate a motor vehicle.</li>
                      <li>2.Road signs in the country are either written in Filipino or English. Since a professional driver’s license is the highest form of LTO license,
                          candidates must be able to read and write in Filipino and/or English.
                          To make sure that candidates are fully committed, they must have passed the required LTO driver's license written and practical examination.</li>
                      <li>3.The last driver's license requirement LTO is imposing is that candidates must be a holder of a valid non-professional driver’s
